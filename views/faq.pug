              h3 OUR JEWELRY
            .text-content 
              h4 What's the material of our jewelry?
              p All our jewelry is made from the highest quality stainless steel, then plated with 18k gold using a technique called PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition). This new way of plating is 10x stronger than standard gold or silver plating, making our jewelry 100% waterproof!
              h4 Are all the products waterproof?
              p This is all possible due to our unique plating process! We use the highest quality stainless steel that is then plated with 18k gold using a technique called PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition). This new, modern way of plating, is ten times thicker than standard gold plating, is environmentally friendly, and uses a vacuum coating process, resulting in an extremely durable finish. This durability naturally makes it almost anything proof!
